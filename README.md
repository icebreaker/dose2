dose2 by mfx
============
This repo contains the source code of the [dose 2][1] _scene demo_ by [mfx][2].

It can be compiled on Linux & Mac with the provided `Makefile`.

In addition it can also be cross compiled via mingw32 to Windows
and Emscripten to Web Assembly.

Specifying the `-window` argument when running the executable will run the
_demo_ in windowed mode. (*duh*)
